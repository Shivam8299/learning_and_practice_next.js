            Before my son was born I swore he would never have a dummy and it was only after a few days of constant crying and thanks to a nappy cake I was given that he ended up having one.  From then on I convinced myself that he would only have it for a little while but of course the older he got the more he relied on it.  In the last year or so we only had it at nap times, long drives and bed but he was 100% addicted to the damn thing and I knew it would be torture when the time came to get rid of it.
